 abstract = {In this article, we describe `twopm`, a command for fitting two-part models for mixed discrete-continuous outcomes. In the two-part model, a binary choice model is fit for the probability of observing a positive-versus-zero outcome. Then, conditional on a positive outcome, an appropriate regression model is fit for the positive outcome. The `twopm` command allows the user to leverage the capabilities of predict and margins to calculate predictions and marginal effects and their standard errors from the combined first- and second-part models.},
