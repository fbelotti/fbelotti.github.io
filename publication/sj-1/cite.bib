 abstract = {In this article, we describe `screening`, a new Stata command for data management that can be used to examine the content of complex narrative-text variables to identify one or more user-defined keywords. The command is useful when dealing with string data contaminated with abbreviations, typos, or mistakes. A rich set of options allows a direct translation from the original narrative string to a user-defined standard coding scheme. Moreover, `screening` is flexible enough to facilitate the merging of information from different sources and to extract or reorganize the content of string variables.},
