 abstract = {Several new statistical tools and analytical frameworks have been recently developed to measure countries' and sectors' involvement in global value chains. Such wealth of methodologies reflects the fact that different empirical questions call for distinct accounting methods, along with different levels of aggregation of trade flows. This paper describes `icio` a new Stata module for the computation of the most appropriate measures of trade in value-added and participation in global value chains. `icio` follows the conceptual framework proposed by Borin and Mancini (2019), which – in turn – extends, refines and reconciles the other main contributions in this strand of the literature. `icio` is flexible enough to work with any inter-country input-output table and with any level of aggregation of trade flows.},
