 abstract = {In this article, we describe `jackknife2`, a new prefix command for jackknifing linear estimators. It takes full advantage of the available leave-one-out formula, thereby allowing for substantial reduction in computing time. Of special note is that `jackknife2` allows the user to compute cross-validation and diagnostic measures that are currently not available after `ivregress 2sls`, `xtreg`, and `xtivregress`.},
