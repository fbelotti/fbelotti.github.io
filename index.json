However, these lives are punctuated by more chronic disease than ever before, contributing to substantial morbidity and disability. Using the Future Elderly Model, we simulate longevity and disability over the remaining lifetime for cohorts of older Europeans and Americans. The model simulates total longevity and disability over the course of a lifetime for representative cohorts of older Europeans and Americans. We then consider two counterfactual scenarios. In the first, we reduce the presence of the chronic illness at age 50, if present (i.e., the impact of removing stock). In the second, we reduce the incidence of chronic disease after age 50, among those developing disease after this age (i.e., the impact of removing flow). We then assess the impact on the treated and the average effect on the overall cohort, in terms of life-years (LYs) and disability-free life-years (DFLYs). We study Europe and the US to understand how differences in older age prevalence and incidence between the two regions influence the burden of disease, as well as the trade-offs between treatment and prevention by disease. We see that investment in both treatment and prevention for cancer, diabetes, and heart disease show tremendous promise for breaking Europe and the United States out of the expensive equilibrium we now find ourselves in as a result of demographic gains.","tags":null,"title":"The return to preventing chronic disease in Europe and United States","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michele Aquaro","Federico Belotti","Ida Johnsson"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1632953794,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1632953794,"objectID":"bb6867e586f9fa76778494c9e0caa47d","permalink":"https://fbelotti.github.io/publication/wip_jss/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wip_jss/","section":"publication","summary":"Aquaro et al.

However, as is well known in this literature, SD makes inference problematic. Indeed, given a specific distance threshold, a sample unit may be the neighbor of a number of units on the opposite side of a specific boundary inducing correlation between all differenced observations that share a common sample unit.

Second, after testing for their potential endogeneity, we study the impact of these practices (and combinations of them) on maize productivity controlling for weather shocks. Finally, we disaggregate results by presence/absence of seasonal rainfall and temperature shocks to explore the heterogeneous impact of adoption under weather shocks. We find strong complementarities between agricultural practices both in terms of adoption and yield impacts. Long-run variability in rainfall decreases the adoption of organic fertilizers and increases that of improved seeds. Farmers in areas where the cropping season’s rainfall has been highly variable and temperature has been unexpectedly high have significantly lower maize yields. SWC emerges as one of the most important practices in increasing yields with significant benefits by itself, in combination with other practices, under average weather conditions as well as under rainfall and temperature shocks. Overall, increasing the adoption of SWC appears a promising policy option to buffer food security from increasingly frequent weather shocks in Tanzania.","tags":["Technology adoption; Productivity analysis; Climate change; Panel data; Tanzania"],"title":"Smallholder productivity and weather shocks: Adoption and impact of widely promoted agricultural practices in Tanzania","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Federico Belotti","Gordon Hughes","Andrea Piano Mortari"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1488326400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617142593,"objectID":"290485861f5838fea1e8a8bc7cdeca86","permalink":"https://fbelotti.github.io/publication/sj-4/","publishdate":"2021-03-30T22:16:33.849787Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sj-4/","section":"publication","summary":"`xsmle` is a new user-written command for spatial analysis.

In the two-part model, a binary choice model is fit for the probability of observing a positive-versus-zero outcome. Then, conditional on a positive outcome, an appropriate regression model is fit for the positive outcome.

In this paper, we propose a simple specification test of the null hypothesis that the individual effects are time-invariant against the alternative that they are time-varying. Our test is an application of Hausman (1978) testing procedure and can be used for any generalized linear model for panel data that admits a sufficient statistic for the individual effect. This is a wide class of models which includes the Gaussian linear model and a variety of nonlinear models typically employed for discrete or categorical outcomes. The basic idea of the test is to compare two alternative estimators of the model parameters based on two different formulations of the conditional maximum likelihood method. Our approach does not require assumptions on the distribution of unobserved heterogeneity, nor it requires the latter to be independent of the regressors in the model. We investigate the finite sample properties of the test through a set of Monte Carlo experiments. Our results show that the test performs well, with small size distortions and good power properties. We use a health economics example based on data from the Health and Retirement Study to illustrate the proposed test.","tags":["Generalized linear models; Longitudinal data; Fixed-effects; Hausman-type tests; Self-reported health"],"title":"Testing for time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity in generalized linear models for panel data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vincenzo Atella","Federico Belotti","Domenico Depalo","Andrea Piano Mortari"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1401580800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617142593,"objectID":"cf26e0f9c791989f36c4063b85b8f180","permalink":"https://fbelotti.github.io/publication/rsue/","publishdate":"2021-03-30T22:16:33.550742Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rsue/","section":"publication","summary":"Over the last decades spatial econometric models have represented a common tool for measuring spillover effects across different geographical entities (counties, provinces, regions or nations). The aim of this paper is to investigate the issue of measuring spatial spillovers in the presence of institutional constraints that can be geographically defined. In these cases, assuming that spatial effects are not affected by the institutional setting may produce biased estimates due to the composition of twodistinct sources of spatial dependence. Our approach is based on redefining the contiguity structure so as to account for the institutional constraints using two different contiguity matrices: the within matrix, which defines contiguity among units obeying the same institutional setting, and the between matrix, which traces spatial linkages among contiguous units across different jurisdictions. This approach allows to disentangle the two sources of spatial correlation and to easily test for the existence of binding institutional constraints. From the econometric perspective, we extend Lacombe (2004) approach to incorporate the aforementioned institutional constraints in a spatial Durbin model with individual specific slopes, while inference is conducted using a two-way cluster robust variance–covariance matrix controlling for both spatial and time correlations. We apply this methodology to analyze spatial dependence of per-capita public health expenditures in Italyat Local Health Authority level using a balanced panel dataset from 2001 to 2005. Our results show robust evidence of a significant and positive spatial coefficient for the within effect, while the between effect, although significant, is very close to zero, thus confirming the importance and validity of the proposed approach.","tags":["Spatial; Health expenditures; Institutional setting; Panel data"],"title":"Measuring spatial effects in the presence of institutional constraints: The case of Italian Local Health Authority expenditure","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Federico Belotti","Silvio Daidone","Giuseppe Ilardi","Vincenzo Atella"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1385856000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617142593,"objectID":"8ff256c3fd70a4f4a8eb5dedade93810","permalink":"https://fbelotti.github.io/publication/sj-2/","publishdate":"2021-03-30T22:16:33.242899Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sj-2/","section":"publication","summary":"This article describes `sfcross` and `sfpanel`, two new Stata commands for the estimation of cross-sectional and panel-data stochastic frontier models. `sfcross` extends the capabilities of the `frontier` command by including additional models (Greene, 2003, Journal of Productivity Analysis 19: 179–190; Wang, 2002, Journal of Productivity Analysis 18: 241–253) and command functionalities, such as the possibility of managing complex survey data characteristics.

We show that the combination of internal competencies and context-specific factors is different when explaining decisions to start e-government activities vs. the intensity of such activities. Municipalities involved in e-government are larger, carry out more in-house ICT activities and are more likely to have intranet infrastructures than PAs that do not offer front-office digitized services. They are also generally located in regions having relatively large shares of firms using or producing ICTs, where many other municipalities offer digitized services, and where population density is relatively low. The range and quality of e-government services supplied by local PAs tend to increase with their stock of ICT competencies, their efforts to train workers, and with their ability to organise efficient interfaces with end-users. Moreover, there is a correlation between the range and quality of e-government services offered and the broadband infrastructure development in the area where local PAs are located.","tags":["Innovation system; Dynamic capabilities; Technology adoption; Electronic government; Innovation in services"],"title":"Technology adoption and innovation in public services the case of e-government in Italy","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://fbelotti.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"},{"authors":["Federico Belotti","Giancarlo Ferrara"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"3e1f3835e5645d7232934812eeb2d336","permalink":"https://fbelotti.github.io/publication/submitted_sfsplines/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/submitted_sfsplines/","section":"publication","summary":"Despite its importance, the monotonicity condition is typically overlooked in stochastic frontier analysis.

The simulation results highlight very good performance of the new algorithm which outperforms the competitors in small samples and in presence of small signal-to-noise ratios.

In addition to the usual smoothing over lagged autocovariances for classical HAC estimators, the DK-HAC estimator also applies smoothing over the time direction. We obtain the optimal bandwidths that jointly minimize the global asymptotic MSE criterion and discuss the trade-off between bias and variance with respect to smoothing over lagged autocovariances and over time. Unlike the MSE results of Andrews (1991), we establish how nonstationarity affects the bias-variance trade-off. We use the plug-in approach to construct data-dependent bandwidths for the DK-HAC estimators and compare them with the DK-HAC estimators from Casini (2021) that use data-dependent bandwidths obtained from a sequential MSE criterion. The former performs better in terms of size control, especially with stationary and close to stationary data. Finally, we consider long-run variance estimation under the assumption that the series is a function of a nonparametric estimator rather than of a semiparametric estimator that enjoys the usual $\\sqrt{T}$ rate of convergence. Thus, we also establish the validity of consistent long-run variance estimation in nonparametric parameter estimation settings.","tags":null,"title":"Simultaneous bandwidths determination for DK-HAC estimators and long-run variance estimation in nonparametric settings","type":"publication"}]
