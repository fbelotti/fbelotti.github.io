The adoption of a consistent criterion for outlier detection is useful in many practical applications, particularly when international and intertemporal comparisons are involved.

It presents  **outdetect**, a Stata command that implements the procedure and provides useful diagnostic tools. The output of **outdetect** compares statistics obtained before and after the exclusion of outliers, with a focus on inequality and poverty measures. Finally, the paper carries out an extensive sensitivity exercise, where the same outlier detection method is applied consistently to per capita expenditure across more than 30 household budget surveys.

However, the success of this effort depends on the ability to generate precise estimates that can aid in the implementation of new laws and regulations.

In this paper, we conduct a replication exercise to investigate the impact of outliers on estimated causal effects. Our analysis is based on about 92 articles that were published in 2017 in nine top economic journals and are reproducible. After replicating the results using robust estimators (MDPD and MM), we found that outliers change the magnitude of coefficients and, in some cases, even the sign. This was the case for a substantial number of the articles we examined.

We obtain the optimal bandwidths that jointly minimize the global asymptotic MSE criterion and discuss the tradeoff between bias and variance with respect to smoothing over lagged autocovariances and over time. Unlike the MSE results of Andrews, we establish how nonstationarity affects the bias-variance tradeoff. We use the plug-in approach to construct data-dependent bandwidths for the DK-HAC estimators and compare them with the DK-HAC estimators from Casini that use data-dependent bandwidths obtained from a sequential MSE criterion. The former performs better in terms of size control, especially with stationary and close to stationary data. Finally, we consider long-run variance (LRV) estimation under the assumption that the series is a function of a nonparametric estimator rather than of a semiparametric estimator that enjoys the usual $\\sqrt{T}$ rate of convergence.

The model simulates total longevity and disability over the course of a lifetime for representative cohorts of older Europeans and Americans. We then consider two counterfactual scenarios. In the first, we reduce the presence of the chronic illness at age 50, if present (i.e., the impact of removing stock). In the second, we reduce the incidence of chronic disease after age 50, among those developing disease after this age (i.e., the impact of removing flow). We then assess the impact on the treated and the average effect on the overall cohort, in terms of life-years (LYs) and disability-free life-years (DFLYs). We study Europe and the US to understand how differences in older age prevalence and incidence between the two regions influence the burden of disease, as well as the trade-offs between treatment and prevention by disease.

The analysis is based on data collected by 900 GP on an unbalanced sample of more than 1 million patients aged 35+, observed in different time periods between 2005 and 2014. In 2014, 86% of the Italian adults older than 65 had at least one chronic condition, and 56.7% had two or more. Prevalence of multiple chronic diseases and healthcare utilization increased among older and younger adults between 2004 and 2014. Indeed, in the last 10 years, average number of prescriptions increased by approximately 26%, while laboratory and diagnostic tests by 27%. The average number of DDD prescribed increased with age in all the observed years (from 114 in 2005 to 119.9 in 2014 for the 35–50 age group and from 774.9 to 1,178.1 for the 81+ patients). The alarming rising trends in the prevalence of chronic disease and associated healthcare costs in Italy, as well as in many other developed countries, call for an urgent implementation of interventions that prevent or slow the accumulation of metabolic and molecular damage associated with multiple chronic disease.","tags":[""],"title":"Trends in Age-Related Disease Burden and Health Care Utilization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Federico Belotti","Edoardo Di Porto","Gianluca Santoni"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1527811200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617142594,"objectID":"7ddc3a3aa23cecb5b864cf29495b4599","permalink":"https://fbelotti.github.io/publication/cesifo/","publishdate":"2021-03-30T22:16:34.301967Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cesifo/","section":"publication","summary":"Spatial differencing (SD) is a spatial data transformation pioneered by Holmes (1998) increasingly used to estimate causal effects with non-experimental data.

Second, after testing for their potential endogeneity, we study the impact of these practices (and combinations of them) on maize productivity controlling for weather shocks. Finally, we disaggregate results by presence/absence of seasonal rainfall and temperature shocks to explore the heterogeneous impact of adoption under weather shocks. We find strong complementarities between agricultural practices both in terms of adoption and yield impacts. Long-run variability in rainfall decreases the adoption of organic fertilizers and increases that of improved seeds. Farmers in areas where the cropping season’s rainfall has been highly variable and temperature has been unexpectedly high have significantly lower maize yields. SWC emerges as one of the most important practices in increasing yields with significant benefits by itself, in combination with other practices, under average weather conditions as well as under rainfall and temperature shocks. Overall, increasing the adoption of SWC appears a promising policy option to buffer food security from increasingly frequent weather shocks in Tanzania.","tags":["Technology adoption; Productivity analysis; Climate change; Panel data; Tanzania"],"title":"Smallholder productivity and weather shocks: Adoption and impact of widely promoted agricultural practices in Tanzania","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Federico Belotti","Gordon Hughes","Andrea Piano Mortari"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1488326400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617142593,"objectID":"290485861f5838fea1e8a8bc7cdeca86","permalink":"https://fbelotti.github.io/publication/sj-4/","publishdate":"2021-03-30T22:16:33.849787Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sj-4/","section":"publication","summary":"`xsmle` is a new user-written command for spatial analysis.

The proportion of younger and older adults reporting no chronic disease decreased with increasing BMI. After adjustment for age, sex, geographic residence, and GPs heterogeneity, a strong J‐shaped association was found between BMI and total health care costs, more pronounced in middle‐aged and older adults. Relative to normal weight, in the 45‐64 age group, the per‐capita total cost was 10% higher in overweight individuals, and 27 to 68% greater in patients with obesity and very severe obesity, respectively.

In this paper, we propose a simple specification test of the null hypothesis that the individual effects are time-invariant against the alternative that they are time-varying. Our test is an application of Hausman (1978) testing procedure and can be used for any generalized linear model for panel data that admits a sufficient statistic for the individual effect. This is a wide class of models which includes the Gaussian linear model and a variety of nonlinear models typically employed for discrete or categorical outcomes. The basic idea of the test is to compare two alternative estimators of the model parameters based on two different formulations of the conditional maximum likelihood method. Our approach does not require assumptions on the distribution of unobserved heterogeneity, nor it requires the latter to be independent of the regressors in the model. We investigate the finite sample properties of the test through a set of Monte Carlo experiments. Our results show that the test performs well, with small size distortions and good power properties. We use a health economics example based on data from the Health and Retirement Study to illustrate the proposed test.","tags":["Generalized linear models; Longitudinal data; Fixed-effects; Hausman-type tests; Self-reported health"],"title":"Testing for time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity in generalized linear models for panel data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vincenzo Atella","Federico Belotti","Domenico Depalo","Andrea Piano Mortari"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1401580800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617142593,"objectID":"cf26e0f9c791989f36c4063b85b8f180","permalink":"https://fbelotti.github.io/publication/rsue/","publishdate":"2021-03-30T22:16:33.550742Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rsue/","section":"publication","summary":"Over the last decades spatial econometric models have represented a common tool for measuring spillover effects across different geographical entities (counties, provinces, regions or nations). The aim of this paper is to investigate the issue of measuring spatial spillovers in the presence of institutional constraints that can be geographically defined. In these cases, assuming that spatial effects are not affected by the institutional setting may produce biased estimates due to the composition of twodistinct sources of spatial dependence. Our approach is based on redefining the contiguity structure so as to account for the institutional constraints using two different contiguity matrices: the within matrix, which defines contiguity among units obeying the same institutional setting, and the between matrix, which traces spatial linkages among contiguous units across different jurisdictions. This approach allows to disentangle the two sources of spatial correlation and to easily test for the existence of binding institutional constraints. From the econometric perspective, we extend Lacombe (2004) approach to incorporate the aforementioned institutional constraints in a spatial Durbin model with individual specific slopes, while inference is conducted using a two-way cluster robust variance–covariance matrix controlling for both spatial and time correlations. We apply this methodology to analyze spatial dependence of per-capita public health expenditures in Italyat Local Health Authority level using a balanced panel dataset from 2001 to 2005. Our results show robust evidence of a significant and positive spatial coefficient for the within effect, while the between effect, although significant, is very close to zero, thus confirming the importance and validity of the proposed approach.","tags":["Spatial; Health expenditures; Institutional setting; Panel data"],"title":"Measuring spatial effects in the presence of institutional constraints: The case of Italian Local Health Authority expenditure","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Federico Belotti","Silvio Daidone","Giuseppe Ilardi","Vincenzo Atella"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1385856000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617142593,"objectID":"8ff256c3fd70a4f4a8eb5dedade93810","permalink":"https://fbelotti.github.io/publication/sj-2/","publishdate":"2021-03-30T22:16:33.242899Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sj-2/","section":"publication","summary":"This article describes `sfcross` and `sfpanel`, two new Stata commands for the estimation of cross-sectional and panel-data stochastic frontier models. `sfcross` extends the capabilities of the `frontier` command by including additional models (Greene, 2003, Journal of Productivity Analysis 19: 179–190; Wang, 2002, Journal of Productivity Analysis 18: 241–253) and command functionalities, such as the possibility of managing complex survey data characteristics.
